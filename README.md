# Snips-MeyPVLogger
Snips app to control my personal and private logger solution for my photovoltaics plant. This proprietary logger solution is named "MeyPVLogger".

The snips app allows querying current and historical earnings by speach. Supported intents are:

- queryTodayEarnings (example phrases: "Ertrag heute", "Wieviel hat die PV Anlage heute produziert?")



This GitHub project only contains the action scripts belonging used by the snips app. The snips app itself is not public. It is private and proprietary as  the logger solution is.
